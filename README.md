# NoteCrypt
Keep your notes safe and secure with Note Crypt for Android!


* Create different encrypted, with password, database files.
* Add new notes in a database choosing for each of them: title, tags and text of the note.
* Filter by Tag the list of the notes.
* Mark the notes as important by clicking the star icon.
* Sorting notes by name or creation date.
* Change the password of an existing database.
* The database is securely encrypted with AES 128 bit, using cipher-block chaining (CBC), PKCS5Padding and a random IV generated at every save. For the KDF a random salt and PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 are used.
* Auto create a hidden backup database to prevent data loss in case the file gets corrupted while saving (the backup file is saved with the name: ."database name").
* Ability to search through your notes.

If you forget your password, the notes will be inaccessible.
